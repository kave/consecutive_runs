Write a python function named “find_consecutive_runs” that accepts as an argument a list of integers. 
It must find in that list all runs of 3 consecutive numbers that increase or decrease by 1. 
It should return the list indices of the first element of each run. 
If there are no consecutive runs it should return None.
 
Example: [1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 7, 8, 7] returns [0, 4, 6, 7]


# USAGE
`python integer_consecutive_runs.py "[1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 7, 8, 7]"`
 - Output
  - `[Result]: [0, 4, 6, 7]`
